# Using C# and .NET to improve your website's SEO

This repository complements the post written for the [C# Christmas Advent](https://www.csadvent.christmas/) for 2024 titled "[Harnessing .NET and C# for Better SEO: How It Can Boost Your Website Rankings](https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/harnessing-net-and-c-for-better-seo-how-it-can-boost-your-website-rankings-RX)"

The post focuses and explains how to use C# with the latest .NET 9.0 features to perform the following:
 1. Create a Middleware component to minify HTML back to the browser.
 2. Analyze a post and determine the most used keywords in the text
 3. Make API calls to a third-party service to analyze search engine traffic, identify popular keywords, and backlink analysis for starters.

If interested in additional SEO utilities using C#, please post a comment, question, or complaint in the article and we'll see what develops... ;-)

Enjoy!
